## Opening Remarks

**SECRETARY-GENERAL GUTERRES**: Good morning, distinguished delegates. Today we convene to discuss the urgent matter of establishing binding carbon emission targets for the next decade. The science is clear - we must act decisively to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

## Country Statements

### United States of America

**AMBASSADOR JOHNSON (USA)**: Thank you, Mr. Secretary-General. The United States strongly supports ambitious climate action and is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. We propose a 50% reduction in global emissions by 2030, with developed nations leading by example. 

The US has already invested $400 billion in clean energy infrastructure and is prepared to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance to developing nations. We believe market-based solutions, including carbon pricing and green technology innovation, are essential for achieving these targets.

However, we must ensure that climate policies do not undermine economic competitiveness. Any framework must include provisions for carbon border adjustments to prevent carbon leakage and protect domestic industries transitioning to clean energy.

### European Union

**AMBASSADOR MÜLLER (EU)**: The European Union welcomes this discussion and reaffirms our commitment to the European Green Deal. We have already committed to reducing emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and we are on track to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.

The EU strongly advocates for legally binding emission reduction targets with robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. We propose establishing an international carbon court to ensure compliance and address disputes. Additionally, we support the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies globally by 2025.

We are prepared to increase our climate finance contributions to €30 billion annually and call for the establishment of a loss and damage fund for vulnerable nations. The EU believes that climate action and economic prosperity are not mutually exclusive - our green transition has created 2.4 million jobs in the renewable energy sector alone.

### China

**AMBASSADOR WANG (CHINA)**: China appreciates the opportunity to contribute to this vital discussion. As the world's largest developing country, China faces unique challenges in balancing economic development with environmental protection.

China has made significant progress in renewable energy deployment, accounting for 40% of global renewable capacity additions last year. We have committed to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Our investments in solar, wind, and electric vehicle technologies demonstrate our commitment to green development.

However, we emphasize the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Developed countries must take the lead in emission reductions and provide adequate financial and technological support to developing nations. China supports a differentiated approach to emission targets based on national circumstances and development needs.

We propose the establishment of a global green technology sharing mechanism to accelerate the transfer of clean technologies to developing countries at affordable costs.

### India

**AMBASSADOR SHARMA (INDIA)**: India acknowledges the urgency of climate action while emphasizing the need for climate justice and equity. With 1.4 billion people, India's priority is sustainable development that lifts millions out of poverty while protecting the environment.

India has exceeded our Paris Agreement commitments ahead of schedule, achieving 40% renewable energy capacity and reducing emission intensity by 33% since 2005. We are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070 and installing 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.

However, India strongly opposes uniform emission reduction targets that ignore historical responsibilities and current development needs. Per capita emissions in India remain significantly lower than developed countries. We call for differentiated targets based on cumulative historical emissions and per capita consumption.

India supports the creation of a $1 trillion climate finance facility and demands technology transfer without intellectual property restrictions. Climate action cannot come at the cost of development aspirations of billions in the Global South.

### Brazil

**AMBASSADOR SILVA (BRAZIL)**: Brazil brings a unique perspective as a country with vast forest resources and significant renewable energy potential. We are committed to ending illegal deforestation in the Amazon by 2030 and restoring 12 million hectares of degraded land.

Brazil's energy matrix is already 83% renewable, and we have reduced deforestation rates by 60% over the past decade. We propose recognizing forest conservation and restoration as equivalent to emission reductions in any global framework.

However, Brazil requires international support to achieve these ambitious goals. We call for debt-for-climate swaps and direct payments for ecosystem services. The international community must recognize that forest conservation is a global public good that deserves compensation.

Brazil supports flexible mechanisms that allow countries to meet targets through various pathways, including nature-based solutions, renewable energy deployment, and sustainable agriculture practices.

### Small Island Developing States (Represented by Maldives)

**AMBASSADOR HASSAN (MALDIVES)**: The Maldives speaks on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), representing 39 nations facing existential threats from climate change. For us, this is not about economic targets - it is about survival.

We demand immediate and drastic emission reductions of 45% by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 globally. Half-measures and voluntary commitments have failed. We need legally binding targets with severe penalties for non-compliance.

AOSIS calls for the establishment of a climate emergency fund of $500 billion annually, with automatic access for vulnerable nations. We also demand the recognition of climate-induced displacement and the creation of climate refugee protection mechanisms.

The loss and damage fund must be operationalized immediately with contributions based on historical emissions and current capacity. Climate justice demands that those least responsible for the crisis receive the most support.

## Technical Discussion

### Carbon Pricing Mechanisms

**TECHNICAL EXPERT DR. PETERSON**: The economic modeling suggests that a global carbon price of $75-100 per ton CO2 by 2030 would be necessary to achieve the required emission reductions. This could be implemented through various mechanisms including carbon taxes, cap-and-trade systems, or hybrid approaches.

### Monitoring and Verification

**CLIMATE SCIENTIST DR. CHEN**: Satellite monitoring and AI-powered emission tracking systems can provide real-time verification of national emission inventories. The proposed Global Carbon Observatory would ensure transparency and accountability in emission reporting.

## Closing Statements

**SECRETARY-GENERAL GUTERRES**: Distinguished delegates, the diversity of perspectives shared today reflects both the complexity of our challenge and the richness of potential solutions. While differences remain on specific targets and mechanisms, there is clear consensus on the urgency of action.

The next phase of negotiations will focus on reconciling these positions into a comprehensive framework that is both ambitious and equitable. Time is not on our side, but with political will and international cooperation, we can still limit global warming and build a sustainable future for all.
