## Member State Positions

### United Kingdom

**AMBASSADOR THOMPSON (UK)**: The United Kingdom is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation. We call for an immediate ceasefire and the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces to establish a buffer zone between conflicting parties.

The UK proposes a three-phase approach: immediate humanitarian corridor establishment, followed by confidence-building measures, and finally comprehensive peace negotiations under UN auspices. We are prepared to contribute 2,000 peacekeepers and £50 million in humanitarian aid.

We emphasize that any resolution must respect international law and territorial integrity. The UK will not support any solution that rewards aggression or undermines the principles of the UN Charter.

### Russian Federation

**AMBASSADOR PETROV (RUSSIA)**: Russia views this crisis as a result of external interference in regional affairs. The root causes lie in the expansion of military alliances and the deployment of foreign military assets near sensitive borders.

Russia supports a negotiated settlement that addresses the legitimate security concerns of all parties. We propose the establishment of a neutral zone and the withdrawal of all foreign military advisors from the region.

Any peacekeeping mission must have the consent of all parties and should not serve as a pretext for permanent foreign military presence. Russia is prepared to participate in peacekeeping operations under strict UN mandate and with clear exit timelines.

We call for the lifting of unilateral sanctions that have exacerbated humanitarian suffering and hindered diplomatic solutions.

### United States

**AMBASSADOR MARTINEZ (USA)**: The United States condemns the unprovoked aggression that has led to this crisis. We stand firmly with our allies and partners in defending the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The US supports immediate humanitarian access and the protection of civilian populations. We are prepared to provide $200 million in emergency humanitarian assistance and medical supplies to affected areas.

However, we cannot accept any solution that legitimizes territorial changes achieved through force. The US calls for the immediate withdrawal of all occupying forces to internationally recognized borders as a precondition for meaningful negotiations.

We support targeted sanctions against those responsible for violations of international law and are prepared to strengthen our military assistance to affected allies within the framework of collective defense.

### China

**AMBASSADOR LI (CHINA)**: China calls for restraint from all parties and emphasizes the importance of dialogue and consultation in resolving disputes. Military solutions will only lead to greater suffering and instability.

China proposes a comprehensive peace conference involving all stakeholders, including regional organizations and neighboring countries. We believe that sustainable peace can only be achieved through addressing the root causes of conflict, including economic disparities and historical grievances.

China is prepared to provide humanitarian assistance and contribute to post-conflict reconstruction efforts. We support the establishment of economic cooperation zones that can provide incentives for peaceful coexistence.

We oppose the politicization of humanitarian issues and call for the separation of humanitarian assistance from political conditions.

### Germany

**AMBASSADOR WEBER (GERMANY)**: Germany strongly supports multilateral diplomatic efforts to resolve this crisis. As a country that has experienced division and reunification, we understand the importance of patient diplomacy and gradual confidence-building.

Germany proposes the establishment of a Contact Group including the EU, UN, and regional organizations to facilitate sustained dialogue. We are prepared to host peace negotiations in Berlin and provide €100 million for reconstruction and reconciliation programs.

We emphasize the importance of civil society engagement and people-to-people contacts in building lasting peace. Germany calls for the protection of cultural heritage sites and the facilitation of family reunifications across conflict lines.

### Non-Permanent Members Perspective

**AMBASSADOR OKAFOR (NIGERIA)**: Speaking for the African members of the Security Council, we emphasize that regional conflicts require regional solutions supported by international partners.

Africa has extensive experience in peacekeeping and conflict resolution. We propose the deployment of a hybrid UN-Regional Organization peacekeeping force with strong civilian protection mandates.

We call for increased investment in conflict prevention mechanisms and early warning systems. The international community must address the structural causes of conflict, including poverty, inequality, and weak governance.

## Humanitarian Briefing

**UN HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR**: The current crisis has displaced over 500,000 people and created urgent humanitarian needs. Access to affected populations remains severely limited due to ongoing hostilities.

Immediate priorities include:
- Establishment of humanitarian corridors
- Protection of medical facilities and schools
- Provision of clean water and sanitation
- Psychological support for trauma victims

The humanitarian response requires $300 million over the next six months. We call on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and facilitate unimpeded humanitarian access.

## Regional Perspectives

### European Union

**EU REPRESENTATIVE**: The European Union reaffirms its commitment to peaceful conflict resolution and respect for international law. The EU has imposed targeted sanctions and is prepared to increase humanitarian assistance to €150 million.

We support the deployment of EU civilian monitors to observe ceasefire compliance and facilitate dialogue between communities. The EU's experience in post-conflict reconstruction can contribute to long-term stability.

### African Union

**AU REPRESENTATIVE**: The African Union offers its mediation services and proposes the deployment of AU peace observers. Africa's experience in conflict resolution, including truth and reconciliation processes, can provide valuable lessons.

We emphasize the importance of women's participation in peace processes and call for the inclusion of youth representatives in all negotiations.
