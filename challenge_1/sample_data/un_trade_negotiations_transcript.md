## Ministerial Statements

### Japan

**MINISTER TANAKA (JAPAN)**: Japan advocates for a rules-based multilateral trading system that promotes innovation and sustainable development. We propose the establishment of a Global Digital Trade Framework that addresses data governance, digital taxation, and cross-border data flows.

Japan has successfully integrated environmental standards into our trade policies, reducing carbon intensity in our export industries by 30% over the past decade. We offer to share our green technology and expertise through preferential trade arrangements with developing countries.

We support the creation of supply chain resilience mechanisms that reduce dependency on single sources while maintaining efficiency. Japan proposes a $50 billion fund for supply chain diversification in critical sectors including semiconductors, rare earth minerals, and medical supplies.

However, we emphasize that any new trade framework must protect intellectual property rights and maintain high standards for product safety and quality.

### India

**MINISTER PATEL (INDIA)**: India brings the perspective of the world's most populous nation and a rapidly growing economy. Our priority is ensuring that global trade serves the development needs of our 1.4 billion people.

India supports the liberalization of services trade, particularly in IT, healthcare, and education sectors where we have competitive advantages. We propose the recognition of digital nomad visas and the facilitation of temporary movement of skilled professionals.

However, we strongly oppose any attempt to impose uniform labor and environmental standards that ignore development realities. India calls for special and differential treatment for developing countries, including longer implementation periods and technical assistance.

We demand the elimination of agricultural subsidies in developed countries that distort global food markets and harm farmers in developing nations. India proposes a global food security reserve system to address supply chain disruptions.

### Germany

**MINISTER SCHMIDT (GERMANY)**: Germany, as Europe's largest economy, is committed to sustainable and inclusive trade. We propose mandatory due diligence requirements for supply chains to ensure respect for human rights and environmental standards.

Germany supports the integration of carbon border adjustments into trade agreements to prevent carbon leakage and protect industries transitioning to clean energy. We are prepared to provide technical assistance to help developing countries meet these standards.

We advocate for the digitalization of trade procedures to reduce costs and increase transparency. Germany proposes the creation of a global trade blockchain platform for document verification and supply chain tracking.

However, we insist that any trade liberalization must be accompanied by strong social protection measures and support for workers in transitioning industries.

### Brazil

**MINISTER SANTOS (BRAZIL)**: Brazil emphasizes the importance of agricultural trade and the sustainable use of natural resources. We oppose protectionist measures disguised as environmental policies that restrict access to global markets.

Brazil proposes the recognition of sustainable agriculture certifications and the creation of premium markets for environmentally friendly products. We are prepared to lead a global initiative on sustainable forestry and agriculture practices.

We call for the elimination of export restrictions on food products and the establishment of emergency food trade corridors during crises. Brazil supports the creation of a global food price stabilization mechanism.

However, we demand that environmental standards be based on scientific evidence and not used as barriers to trade. Brazil insists on the right to develop our natural resources in a sustainable manner.

### South Africa

**MINISTER MBEKI (SOUTH AFRICA)**: South Africa speaks for the African continent and emphasizes the need for trade policies that promote industrialization and value addition in developing countries.

We propose preferential market access for processed goods from least developed countries and the elimination of tariff escalation that penalizes value addition. Africa has vast mineral resources but lacks the capacity to process them locally due to trade barriers.

South Africa supports the establishment of regional value chains and South-South trade cooperation. We call for the creation of an African Continental Free Trade Area implementation fund with international support.

We demand the reform of intellectual property rules that prevent access to essential medicines and technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the need for more flexible IP regimes during health emergencies.

### United States

**SECRETARY JOHNSON (USA)**: The United States supports free and fair trade that creates jobs and opportunities for American workers and businesses. We propose strengthening labor standards and environmental protections in all trade agreements.

The US advocates for digital trade rules that promote innovation while protecting privacy and security. We support the free flow of data across borders with appropriate safeguards for national security and personal privacy.

We call for the elimination of forced technology transfer requirements and the protection of trade secrets. The US proposes enhanced dispute resolution mechanisms with binding enforcement powers.

However, we insist that any trade agreement must include strong provisions against currency manipulation and state subsidies that distort competition. The US will not accept trade deals that disadvantage American workers and businesses.

### China

**MINISTER WANG (CHINA)**: China supports an open, inclusive, and rules-based multilateral trading system. As the world's second-largest economy, China is committed to further opening its markets and promoting global economic integration.

China proposes the expansion of the Belt and Road Initiative to include more countries and sectors, with enhanced transparency and sustainability standards. We offer $100 billion in infrastructure financing for developing countries.

We support the digitalization of trade and the development of e-commerce platforms that connect small and medium enterprises to global markets. China's experience in digital payments and logistics can benefit the global trading system.

However, we oppose unilateral sanctions and trade wars that undermine global supply chains and economic stability. China calls for the resolution of trade disputes through dialogue and multilateral mechanisms.
